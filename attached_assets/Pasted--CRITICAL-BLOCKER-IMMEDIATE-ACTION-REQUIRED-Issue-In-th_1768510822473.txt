🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKER — IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Issue:  
In the admin research form text editor, numbered and bulleted lists **still fail to inherit formatting**. Bold, italic, underline, font size, font family, and color applied to list items do **not** propagate to numbers or bullets. This is a **persistent, editor-level defect**, despite all previous claimed “engine-level fixes.”  

CSS-only solutions, pseudo-elements, and import-level workarounds are **not acceptable**. Partial fixes or temporary patches have failed repeatedly. This is a **production-blocking issue**.  

Requirements:

1. **Full Engine-Level Fix**
   - The editor must implement list marker formatting inheritance **in real-time**, including:
     - Font size
     - Font family
     - Color
     - Bold, Italic, Underline
   - Must work for:
     - Nested lists
     - Undo/Redo
     - Copy/Paste
     - Real-time typing

2. **Editor Integration**
   - Toolbar commands (bold, font size, color, italic) must **update both text and list markers simultaneously**.
   - Do not rely on CSS hacks (::before, inline-block, white-space) or pseudo-elements.

3. **Fallback / Replacement**
   - If the current editor cannot support reliable marker formatting, **it must be replaced** with a proven WYSIWYG editor (e.g., CKEditor 5, TipTap) configured correctly for full marker inheritance.

4. **Verification Steps**
   - Type numbered and bulleted lists.
   - Apply **bold, italic, underline, font size, font family, and color**.
   - Confirm **numbers/bullets update in real-time**.
   - Test nested lists, undo/redo, copy/paste.
   - All other editor functionality (LTR typing, alignment, spacing, undo/redo) must remain fully operational.

5. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Numbers and bullets **fully reflect all formatting** of the text.
   - No CSS-only or partial fixes accepted.
   - Editor is fully usable in production research forms.
   - This is a **blocking defect**. Resolution must be confirmed with full manual testing before marking complete.

⚠️ Replit: All previous claimed fixes have **not resolved the issue**. This defect must be addressed immediately at the **engine level**, with **complete and verified inheritance of formatting for list markers**. Partial solutions will no longer be accepted.
