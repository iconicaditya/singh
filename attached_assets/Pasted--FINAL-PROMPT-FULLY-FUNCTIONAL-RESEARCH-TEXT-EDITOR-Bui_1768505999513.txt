🚨 FINAL PROMPT — FULLY FUNCTIONAL RESEARCH TEXT EDITOR

Build a fully functional paragraph editor for the Research Form. The current editor is broken, and CSS or minor fixes are not acceptable. Implement a standards-compliant, LTR, fully featured text editor.

1. CORE TYPING BEHAVIOR
- Text must insert to the right of the cursor.
- Cursor must move left → right naturally.
- Words and sentences must grow from left to right.
- No reversed insertion, no mirrored cursor, no RTL behavior.

2. EDITOR ENGINE
- Use stable editor implementation:
  - Allowed: native contenteditable (uncontrolled), Quill, TipTap, Slate, or CKEditor.
- Do NOT use partially controlled custom editors that manipulate content or cursor manually.

3. STRICTLY FORBIDDEN
- Manual caret handling (Selection, Range.insertNode)
- Updating innerHTML or textContent on every keystroke
- Controlled React/Vue state bound to editor value
- onInput or onKeyDown rewriting content
- RTL inheritance from parent containers
- flex-direction: row-reverse

4. INITIALIZATION REQUIREMENTS
<div contenteditable="true" dir="ltr" lang="en" spellcheck="true"></div>
- Initialize once; do not re-render or replace during typing.
- Isolate editor from external RTL or locale styles.

5. FEATURES — MUST ALL WORK
- Text Input: normal typing, enter, spaces, cursor, selection
- Formatting: bold,, underline, font family(10 professional), font size(10 - 60), color(top 10 color), text background(top 10 color) alignment (left, center, right and justify)
- Lists: ordered & unordered, nested lists, indentation
- Editing Actions: copy, paste, cut, undo, redo, select all, delete/backspace
- Behavior: cursor never jumps, no reversed insertion, no disappearing text, formatting retained

6. VERIFICATION REQUIRED
- Manually type a full paragraph
- Apply formatting, lists, alignment, copy/paste
- Ensure cursor behaves correctly at all times
Do not mark complete without this manual verification.

7. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Text inserts from left to right
- Cursor moves correctly
- All formatting works
- No RTL behavior or hacks
- Fully usable research text editor

8. FALLBACK IF UNSTABLE
If the current editor cannot be fixed:
Replace it entirely with a proven editor (Quill / TipTap / Slate / CKEditor) in LTR mode.

This is a blocking production issue. Partial fixes, CSS-only changes, or explanations will not be accepted.
