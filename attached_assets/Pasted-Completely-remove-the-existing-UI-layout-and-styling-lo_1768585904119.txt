Completely remove the existing UI, layout, and styling logic of app/research/page.tsx and app/research/[id]/page.tsx, then regenerate them from scratch using a modern, fully responsive, academic-grade design strictly based on the defined Research form fields and database structure. This change must apply ONLY to these two files and must not impact any other frontend pages, components, admin panels, or layouts.

For app/research/page.tsx, design a clean public research listing page that displays all research entries as professional cards with a consistent grid system, proper spacing, and mobile-first responsiveness. Each card must clearly show the Title Image, Research Title, Category, Year, short tag preview, and a clear call-to-action (e.g., “View Research”). Implement proper pagination (not infinite scroll) with accessible navigation controls, stable layout width, no horizontal overflow, and graceful empty/loading states. Cards must maintain equal height, responsive images, and polished hover states suitable for an institutional research website.

For app/research/[id]/page.tsx, design a focused research detail page that presents content in a readable, structured academic format. The page must prominently render the Title, Year, Category, and Title Image at the top, followed by author profiles (with optional images), then the full Research Content Sections rendered in order with section titles, rich text formatting, and optional section images aligned cleanly within the content flow. Include a clearly separated Related Publications area and a Related Research section showing other relevant research cards based on category or tags. Ensure typography hierarchy, spacing, and image handling are responsive, accessible, and visually professional across all screen sizes.

Do not introduce new data fields, do not modify backend or admin logic, do not rename database keys, and do not reuse old styles or layouts. The result must be visually polished, responsive, production-ready, and suitable for a serious research or institutional website, while remaining fully compatible with the existing database and admin-managed content.
