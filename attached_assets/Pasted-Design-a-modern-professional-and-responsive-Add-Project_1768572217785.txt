Design a modern, professional, and responsive “Add Project” form for a research website admin panel.

⚠️ Important Note:
For now, this form and its logic should NOT impact or modify the frontend user-facing project pages.
All changes should be limited to the admin/backend side only.
Frontend integration and UI updates will be handled later upon instruction.

Another Category (optional dropdown or tag-based input)

⚠️ Reminder:
This implementation must remain isolated from the frontend display logic.
