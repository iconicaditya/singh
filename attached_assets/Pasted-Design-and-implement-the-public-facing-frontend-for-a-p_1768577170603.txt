Design and implement the public-facing frontend for a  project management system using data created from an already implemented admin project form.

⚠️ Important Constraints

The project form and backend API are finalized

Do NOT modify admin logic, database schema, or APIs

Frontend should only consume and display existing data

Any missing data should be handled gracefully in the UI

🔹 Complete Project Data Structure (Source of Truth)

Each project contains the following fields:

1️⃣ Basic Information

Project Title (string, required)

Category (dynamic, required)

Project Date (date, required)

Tags (comma-separated string)

Location (string)

Status (enum: Ongoing | Completed)

Team Members (array):

Name

Role

2️⃣ Media

Title Image (URL)

3️⃣ Project Details

About Project (rich text / HTML content)

Objectives (array of text values)

Short Description (string, required; 2–3 lines)

4️⃣ Linked Content

Attached Research (array of research IDs or objects)

Available only when Status = Completed

🔹 Frontend Pages & Components
1️⃣ Projects Listing Page

Purpose: Showcase all published projects.

Requirements:

Fetch data from /api/projects

Display projects as responsive cards

Each card must include:

Title Image

Project Title

Category badge

Project Date

Short Description

Status indicator (Ongoing / Completed)

Clicking a card navigates to the Project Details page

Optional Enhancements:

Filter by Category

Filter by Status

Search by Project Title or Tags

Component Reference:

Extend components/project.tsx

2️⃣ Project Details Page

Purpose: Display full project information in a structured, academic layout.

🔹 Header Section

Project Title

Category

Status badge

Project Date

Location

Title Image (hero/banner style)

🔹 About Project

Render rich text content safely

🔹 Objectives

Display objectives as a numbered or bullet list

🔹 Team Members

Grid or list layout showing:

Member Name

Role

🔹 Tags

Display tags as small chips/badges

🔹 Conditional Section: Linked Research

Show only if Status = Completed

Display attached research as:

Research title

Short summary (if available)

Link to research detail page

🔹 Navigation Integration

Ensure components/header.tsx provides clear navigation to:

Projects

Research

Add active link styling for better UX

🔹 API Usage

Use existing endpoints only:

GET /api/projects → project list

GET /api/projects/[id] → project details

No API changes allowed.

🔹 UX / UI Guidelines

Clean academic and professional design

Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)

Clear visual hierarchy

Proper spacing and readable typography

Loading states, empty states, and fallback UI

🔹 Technical Stack

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Data Fetching: Fetch API / React Query

Rich text rendering: safe HTML rendering

🔹 Output Expectations

Frontend page structure

Component hierarchy

Clear mapping between form fields and UI

Conditional rendering logic for Completed projects

⚠️ Reminder
The frontend must accurately reflect all data entered via the updated admin form, including project date, objectives list, and linked research visibility.
