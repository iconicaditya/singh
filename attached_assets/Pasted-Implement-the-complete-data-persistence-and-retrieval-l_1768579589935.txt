Implement the complete data persistence and retrieval logic for the Research Management System, ensuring that all information entered through the Admin Research Form is fully stored, updated, and loaded from the database.

⚠️ Strict Scope

Do NOT modify any frontend UI files

Do NOT implement or reference public-facing logic

Do NOT mention or rely on API layers

Focus strictly on admin-side data handling and database operations

Frontend integration will be handled in a later phase

🔹 Existing Admin Context (Read-Only)

The following files already exist and must remain unchanged:

app/admin/research/page.tsx

components/research/ResearchGalleryForm.tsx

All database logic must fully support the data produced and consumed by these files.

🔹 Complete Research Form Data (All Fields Must Be Functional)
1️⃣ Basic Information

Title (required, text)

Category (required, dynamic selection with add-new capability)

Year (required, 4-digit number)

Tags (comma-separated keywords, saved as structured data)

Title Image (image URL, already uploaded externally)

2️⃣ Authors (Dynamic & Fully Functional)

Add Author button must:

Append a new author record

Remove (X) button must:

Remove only the selected author

Each Author contains:

Author Name (required)

Author Image (optional image URL)

3️⃣ Research Content Sections (Dynamic & Ordered)

Add Section button must:

Append a new content block

Remove Section button must:

Delete the selected section only

Each Section contains:

Section Title (required)

Rich Text Content (required, formatted HTML)

Section Image (optional image URL)

Section order must be preserved exactly as entered

4️⃣ Related Publications

Add Publication button must:

Link one or more existing publication records

Publications are optional but must be stored correctly when provided

🔹 Global Form Actions (All Must Be Fully Actionable)

Save Research

Validates all required fields

Persists all structured and nested data

Handles both create and update scenarios

Cancel

Discards all unsaved changes

Restores last persisted state if editing

Close (X)

Exits the form safely without saving

All buttons must perform real, functional operations tied to data persistence or state restoration.

🔹 Database Responsibilities

Implement a database structure that:

Accurately stores:

Dynamic categories

Nested authors with optional images

Ordered rich-text content sections

Tags as searchable data

Optional linked publications

Supports:

Creating new research records

Editing existing research records

Loading saved research back into the admin form

Deleting research entries safely

🔹 Validation & Data Integrity

Enforce the following rules:

Title, Category, Year are mandatory

At least one Author must exist

At least one Content Section must exist

Year must be a valid 4-digit number

Empty authors or sections must not be saved

🔹 Data Flow Scope

✔ Admin Form → Database
✔ Database → Admin Dashboard / Form

❌ No public rendering
❌ No frontend UI changes
❌ No API references

🔹 Output Expectations

Database schema or models

Data persistence logic

Data loading logic for edit mode

Clear mapping between each form field/button and stored data

⚠️ Final Reminder
This task is strictly about making every field and every button in the admin research form fully functional and persistent at the database level.
Public frontend integration will be handled in a separate task.
